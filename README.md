# Color sensitivity of direction-selective cells in the zebrafish optic tectum

In this lab rotation at the [Arrenberg Lab](https://arrenberg-lab.de) we tested, whether direction selective cells in the optic tectum of zebrafish can still encode motion, if the visual stimulus only contained isoluminant, chromatic cues.

The result of this lab rotation was a [poster](poster/main.pdf) as well as a [lab protocol](protocol/main.pdf).
